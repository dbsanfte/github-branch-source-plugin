<div>
    <p>
        A comma-delimited list of Git usernames to ignore push events from. These events will be handled
        and logged by the plugin but will not trigger builds. The obvious use-case for this is
        ignoring push events by a designated Jenkins git user, so that your builds don't trigger
        more builds.
    </p>
    <p>
        This must <strong>exactly</strong> match their Github username.

        <i>jenkinsuser</i><br/>
        <i>jenkinsuser,otheruser,anotheruser,yetanotheruser</i><br/>
